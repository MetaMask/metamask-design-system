# Personal CLAUDE.md Overrides

This file is for your personal preferences and overrides.

Copy this file to `CLAUDE.local.md` and customize for your workflow:

`CLAUDE.local.md` is gitignored and won't be committed.

## What to Put Here

### Personal Coding Style

```markdown
## My Preferences

- Prefer async/await over .then() for promises
- Like shorter variable names (btn vs button)
- Prefer explicit return types on functions
```

### Custom Workflows

```markdown
## My Workflow

When creating components:

1. Start with types first
2. Write tests before implementation
3. Create stories last
```

### Platform Focus

```markdown
## Platform

I primarily work on:

- [ ] React (Web)
- [x] React Native (Mobile)

Prefer React Native patterns and examples.
```

### Testing Preferences

```markdown
## Testing

- Prefer test.each() for variant testing
- Group tests by feature, not type
- Always use userEvent over fireEvent
```

### Communication Style

```markdown
## Communication

- Be concise in responses
- Show code first, explain after
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
```

## Examples

### Component Development

```markdown
## Component Development

When creating components:

- Always start with .types.ts file
- Write comprehensive prop documentation immediately
- Create at least 3 story variations
```

### Git Workflow

```markdown
## Git

My branch naming: feature/[ticket]-description

My commit style: Conventional commits with ticket numbers
```

### IDE Setup

```markdown
## IDE

I use VSCode with:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

Auto-save enabled, don't remind me to save.
```

## Important Notes

- **Gitignored** - Your preferences stay private
- **Team rules take precedence** - Use for personal style, not overriding critical rules
- **Keep concise** - Follow CLAUDE.md principles
- **Test it** - Verify Claude follows your preferences

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't override critical team rules:**

```markdown
# Bad - Conflicts with team standards

- Use string literals instead of enums
- Skip writing tests
```

✅ **Do customize your workflow:**

```markdown
# Good - Personal preferences

- Prefer specific test ordering (arrange, act, assert)
- Add extra comments for complex logic
```
