When the user types `@pr`, automatically generate a comprehensive pull request description and create the PR using GitHub CLI by:

1. **Analyzing the current branch diff** to understand:

   - What files were added, modified, or deleted
   - What components/features were changed
   - The scope and nature of changes (feat, fix, chore, etc.)
   - Any new dependencies or breaking changes

2. **Following the PR template structure** from `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

   - Fill in the Description section with a clear summary
   - Identify any related issues if mentioned in commits
   - Suggest manual testing steps based on changes
   - Note if screenshots/recordings would be helpful
   - Pre-check relevant checklist items

3. **Smart content generation**:

   - **Description**: Write 2-3 sentences explaining what changed and why
   - **Related issues**: Look for issue references in commit messages
   - **Manual testing steps**: Generate realistic testing steps based on the components changed
   - **Screenshots/Recordings**: Suggest if UI/visual changes are detected
   - **Checklist items**: Auto-check items that are clearly satisfied

4. **Component-specific intelligence**:

   - For Figma Code Connect files: Mention design system alignment
   - For React/React Native changes: Note cross-platform consistency
   - For test files: Highlight testing improvements
   - For build/config changes: Note infrastructure updates
   - For documentation: Mention docs updates

5. **Create the PR using GitHub CLI**:

   - Generate a concise PR title based on the changes (e.g., "feat: add Avatar Figma Code Connect integration")
   - Save the generated description to a dynamically created temporary file
   - Use a secure method to create the temporary file and pass its path to the `gh pr create` command
   - Execute: `gh pr create --title "[generated-title]" --body-file [temp-file-path] --draft`
   - If successful, display: "✅ Draft PR created successfully: [PR-URL]"
   - Provide next steps: "Review the description and run `gh pr ready` when ready for review"
   - Ensure the temporary file is deleted after use

6. **Display the generated description and PR creation status**:

```markdown
## **Description**

[Auto-generated description based on diff analysis]

## **Related issues**

[Auto-detected or "Fixes: <!-- Add issue links -->"]

## **Manual testing steps**

[Component-specific testing steps based on changes]

## **Screenshots/Recordings**

[Indicate if needed based on UI changes]

## **Pre-merge author checklist**

- [x] [Auto-check items that are clearly satisfied]
- [ ] [Leave unchecked items that need manual verification]

## **Pre-merge reviewer checklist**

- [ ] I've manually tested the PR (e.g. pull and build branch, run the app, test code being changed).
- [ ] I confirm that this PR addresses all acceptance criteria described in the ticket it closes and includes the necessary testing evidence such as recordings and or screenshots.
```

**Special handling for common patterns**:

- Avatar components → "Enhances avatar component suite with..."
- Figma files → "Adds Figma Code Connect integration for..."
- Build configs → "Updates build configuration to..."
- Bug fixes → "Resolves issue with..."
- New features → "Implements new functionality for..."

**Example auto-generated descriptions**:

- For Avatar Figma files: "Adds Figma Code Connect integration for Avatar components, ensuring design-to-code alignment between React and React Native implementations."
- For build changes: "Updates TypeScript build configuration to exclude Figma Code Connect files from production builds while maintaining development type checking."
- For component updates: "Enhances [ComponentName] with [specific improvements] and ensures cross-platform consistency between React and React Native versions."

**GitHub CLI Integration**:

- Always create PR as draft initially using `--draft` flag
- Use semantic PR titles following conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Show the GitHub CLI command being executed: `gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr_description.md --draft`
- After successful creation, display: "✅ Draft PR created successfully: [PR-URL]"
- Provide next steps: "Review the description and run `gh pr ready` when ready for review"
- If `gh` command fails, display the generated description and provide manual instructions

**Error Handling**:

- If GitHub CLI is not installed: "Please install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` or visit https://cli.github.com"
- If not authenticated: "Please authenticate with GitHub: `gh auth login`"
- If branch has no remote: "Please push your branch first: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`"
