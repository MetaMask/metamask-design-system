## Troubleshooting

### Issues on MacBook with M2 Chip

If you encounter issues while using a MacBook with an M2 chip, follow these steps:

1. **Encountered Error after `pod install`:**

   ```
   [!] Do not use "pod install" from inside Rosetta2 (x86_64 emulation on arm64).

   [!]  - Emulated x86_64 is slower than native arm64

   [!]  - May result in mixed architectures in rubygems (eg: ffi_c.bundle files may be x86_64 with an arm64 interpreter)

   [!] Run "env /usr/bin/arch -arm64 /bin/bash --login" then try again.

   [!] [Codegen] warn: using experimental new codegen integration
   ```

2. **Run Native ARM64 Shell in the terminal:**

   ```bash
   env /usr/bin/arch -arm64 /bin/bash --login
   ```

3. **Remove `.xcode.env.local` File:**

   ```bash
   rm .xcode.env.local
   ```

4. **Run `pod install` Again:**
   ```bash
   pod install
   ```
