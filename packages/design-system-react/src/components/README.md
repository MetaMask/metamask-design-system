# Design System Component Structure

This design system organizes components into two primary groups under the `components` folder:

1. **Core Components** â€“ Fully realized components ready for use by consumers of the design system.
2. **Temp Components** â€“ Temporary or experimental components under review, now located in `components/temp-components`.

Additionally, low-level building blocks (previously in `primitives/`) are now folded into component subdirectories when necessary.

## Folder Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Input/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ temp-components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Spinner/
```

## Components

The `components` folder contains production-ready components intended for direct consumption by product teams or application developers.

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

To expose consistent, accessible, and design-compliant components that abstract away implementation details.

### ðŸ”¹ Usage

- Use components in this folder across applications.
- These components may internally use shared utility functions or abstracted logic, but all public APIs are stable and documented.

### ðŸ”¹ Examples

- `Button`: Offers various visual and interactive variants like Primary, Secondary, etc.
- `Input`: Encapsulates label handling, validation states, and styling.

### ðŸ”¹ Guidelines

- All components must use internal abstractions (like `ButtonBase`, etc.) if needed, but only expose high-level props.
- Components should be thoroughly tested and documented.

---

## Temp Components

The `temp-components` subfolder inside `components` is reserved for in-progress or experimental components.

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

To serve as a staging area for new components that are under active development, review, or iteration.

### ðŸ”¹ Usage

- Developers working on the design system can collaborate and iterate on new ideas here.
- These components **should not** be consumed by external teams until promoted.

### ðŸ”¹ Guidelines

- All files in this folder must be clearly marked as **experimental**.
- Include basic usage and test coverage to gather early feedback.
- Periodically review to either promote the component to `components/` or remove it.

## Best Practices

### âœ… Separation of Concerns

- Core components are grouped under `components/` and should be the only ones consumed outside the design system.
- Temporary or under-review components live in `components/temp-components/`.

### âœ… Naming Conventions

- Use intuitive, PascalCase directory names that match the component name (e.g., `Button/`, `Spinner/`).

### âœ… Documentation

- Components in `components/` must include usage examples and prop documentation.
- Temp components must be clearly marked with a disclaimer indicating their in-progress status.

### âœ… Testing

- All components, whether stable or experimental, should have test coverage to prevent regressions and support ongoing development.

By following this updated structure, the design system supports scalable growth, encourages experimentation, and maintains a clear boundary between internal development and external consumption.
