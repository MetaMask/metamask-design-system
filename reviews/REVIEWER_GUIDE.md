## Recommended Review Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Priority Components (丘멆잺 Critical)
**Time Estimate: 2-3 hours**

1. **Maskicon** - Most complex overall
   - 游댮 **Critical Files**: `Maskicon.utilities.ts` (9.2KB, 308 lines) in both packages
   - 游댮 **Critical Files**: `Maskicon.test.tsx` (10-11KB, 280-300 lines) in both packages
   - **Key Questions**: Code duplication? Algorithm correctness? Performance?

2. **Blockies (React Native)** - Massive utility file
   - 游댮 **Critical File**: `Blockies.utilities.ts` (16KB, 628 lines)
   - **Key Questions**: Why so large? Custom algorithm? Library alternative?

3. **Jazzicon (React)** - Extensive test coverage
   - 游댮 **Critical File**: `Jazzicon.test.tsx` (17KB, 480 lines)
   - **Key Questions**: Over-testing? Test efficiency? Coverage quality?

### Phase 2: Medium-Priority Components (游리 Important)
**Time Estimate: 1-2 hours**

4. **ImageOrSvg** - React Native only, complex implementation
   - 游리 **Focus**: Image handling logic, type complexity, asset optimization
   - **Key Questions**: Platform necessity? Performance implications?

5. **Jazzicon (React Native)** - Implementation disparity
   - 游리 **Focus**: Why much smaller than React version?
   - **Key Questions**: Missing functionality? Adequate testing?

6. **Spinner** - Animation component
   - 游리 **Focus**: Animation performance, library alternatives
   - **Key Questions**: Custom vs existing solutions?

### Phase 3: Lower-Priority Components (游릭 Standard)
**Time Estimate: 30 minutes - 1 hour**

7. **ButtonAnimated** - Animation button
   - 游릭 **Focus**: Animation implementation, integration with main Button
   - **Key Questions**: Should be integrated vs separate?

8. **TextOrChildren** - Simple utility
   - 游릭 **Focus**: Component necessity, documentation proportionality
   - **Key Questions**: Component vs utility function?

9. **Blockies (React)** - Simple implementation
   - 游릭 **Focus**: Why no utilities needed vs React Native?
   - **Key Questions**: External library usage?

## Critical Review Questions

### Code Quality & Architecture
1. **Code Duplication**: Are utilities duplicated between React/React Native?
2. **Library Alternatives**: Could existing libraries replace custom implementations?
3. **Performance**: Are large utility files optimized?
4. **Architecture**: Should utilities be in shared packages?

### Testing & Coverage
1. **Test Efficiency**: Are 480-line test files over-testing?
2. **Coverage Gaps**: Is React Native Jazzicon under-tested?
3. **Utility Testing**: Are large utility files properly tested?
4. **Edge Cases**: Are complex algorithms thoroughly tested?

### Platform Consistency
1. **Implementation Parity**: Why such different approaches between platforms?
2. **Feature Completeness**: Are React Native versions missing functionality?
3. **Type Consistency**: Are type definitions consistent between packages?

### Documentation & Standards
1. **Template Alignment**: Do all README files follow the new template?
2. **Documentation Quality**: Are complex components well-documented?
3. **Story Quality**: Are Storybook examples comprehensive?

## Review Checklist

### For Each Component:
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Logic correctness, performance, maintainability
- [ ] **Testing**: Adequate coverage, quality tests, edge cases
- [ ] **Documentation**: Template compliance, accuracy, completeness
- [ ] **Types**: Type safety, consistency between packages
- [ ] **Stories**: Quality examples, platform-specific scenarios

### Cross-Component Concerns:
- [ ] **Code Duplication**: Utilities shared between packages?
- [ ] **Architecture**: Should utilities be in shared packages?
- [ ] **Consistency**: Similar patterns across components?
- [ ] **Performance**: Any performance implications?

## Time-Saving Tips

### Quick Wins:
1. **Start with utility files** - They contain the most complexity
2. **Compare implementations** - Look for duplication opportunities
3. **Focus on test quality** - Don't just check coverage, check efficiency
4. **Check documentation** - Ensure template compliance

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- **Large utility files** (628+ lines) without clear necessity
- **Test disparities** (480 vs 52 lines) between platforms
- **Code duplication** between React and React Native
- **Over-complex type definitions** for simple components

### Efficiency Shortcuts:
- **Read component implementations first** - Understand before diving into tests
- **Compare similar files** - Look for patterns and differences
- **Focus on high-impact files** - Utilities and complex components first
- **Check for TODOs/FIXMEs** - Often indicate known issues

## Expected Outcomes

### Likely Findings:
1. **Utility duplication** between React/React Native packages
2. **Test inefficiency** in large test files
3. **Platform implementation disparities** requiring explanation
4. **Opportunities for code sharing** and optimization

### Potential Recommendations:
1. **Shared utility packages** for common algorithms
2. **Test optimization** for over-tested components
3. **Implementation alignment** between platforms
4. **Library alternatives** for custom implementations
