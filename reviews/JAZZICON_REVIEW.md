# Jazzicon Component Review

## Overview
The Jazzicon component has the most extensive test coverage (480 lines for React version) and includes utility functions. It exists in both React and React Native packages.

1. **Jazzicon.tsx** (304B, 12 lines)
   - Minimal component implementation
   - Focus: Why so much smaller than React version?

2. **Jazzicon.test.tsx** (1.5KB, 52 lines)
   - Much smaller test file than React version
   - Focus: Adequate test coverage for React Native

3. **Jazzicon.types.ts** (257B, 12 lines)
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Focus: Consistency with React version

4. **Jazzicon.stories.tsx** (1.4KB, 51 lines)

   - Focus: React Native specific docs

## Review Priorities

### üî¥ Critical Review Areas:
1. **Test Coverage Disparity**
   - React: 480 lines vs React Native: 52 lines
   - Why such a huge difference?
   - Is React Native version under-tested?

2. **Component Implementation Difference**
   - React: 98 lines vs React Native: 12 lines
   - Significant implementation differences
   - Missing functionality in React Native?

### üü° Secondary Review Areas:
3. **Utility Functions** (React only)
   - 70 lines of utilities
   - Are these needed for React Native?
   - Code sharing opportunities

4. **Type Definitions**
   - React: 17 lines vs React Native: 12 lines
   - Type consistency between packages

### üü¢ Final Review Areas:
5. **Documentation**
   - Template alignment
   - Accuracy between packages

6. **Stories**
   - Story consistency
   - Platform-specific examples

## Questions for Review:
1. Why is the React Native implementation so much smaller?
2. Are we missing functionality in the React Native version?
3. Why does React need utilities but React Native doesn't?
4. Is the test coverage adequate for React Native?
5. Are the type definitions consistent between packages?

## Suggested Review Order:
1. **Compare component implementations** - understand the size difference
2. **Review React test coverage** - 480 lines is extensive
3. **Check React Native test adequacy** - only 52 lines
4. **Examine utility functions** - why React only?
5. **Compare type definitions** - ensure consistency
6. **Review documentation** - accuracy and completeness

## Files with Potential Issues:
- **Jazzicon.test.tsx (React)** - Potentially over-tested or inefficient
- **Jazzicon.tsx (React Native)** - Potentially under-implemented
- **Jazzicon.utilities.ts** - Why not shared with React Native?
- **Type definitions** - Ensure consistency between packages

## Key Comparison Points:
| Aspect | React | React Native | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------|
| Component size | 98 lines | 12 lines | 8x difference |
| Test coverage | 480 lines | 52 lines | 9x difference |
| Utilities | 70 lines | None | React only |
| Types | 17 lines | 12 lines | Similar |
